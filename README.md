# CodeClause-DataScience
A repo for my projects as a Data Scientist intern at CodeClause
# Project 1 Telcom-Customer-Chrun 
I worked on 
 Explore and analyze the telecom dataset to understand customer behavior.
 
 Implement Logistic Regression, a powerful machine learning algorithm, for churn prediction.
 
 Evaluate the model's performance with key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall score.
# project 2 Market Basket Analysis

Market Basket Analysis is one of the key techniques used by large retailers to uncover associations between items. It works by looking for combinations of items that occur together frequently in transactions. To put it another way, it allows retailers to identify relationships between the items that people buy.

 # Model Used :
 Logistic Regression
 Association Rule Mining
 Apriori Algorithm

Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

# Libriaries used :
Python 
sklearn
numpy
dataframe
matplotlib.pyplot
seaborn
